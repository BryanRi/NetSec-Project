        do so correctly *and respect the network byte order*.

        You are allowed to change the SYN, ACK, and FIN flag locations in the
        flags byte, but make sure to do so correctly everywhere you pack and
        unpack them.

        a checksum of 0 when creating the header for checksum computation.
